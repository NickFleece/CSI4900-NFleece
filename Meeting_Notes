Project Title: Detecting DNS Exfiltration using Machine Learning

Tentative Plan:
- 2 Weeks : Research
- 2 Weeks : Data preprocessing
- 2 Weeks : Data Discretization
- 2 Weeks : Design & Train Algorithm

Sept 18 Meeting:
- Research, look for Datasets, features of said dataset, and ML techniques used for detection
- To setup full implementation plan for next week
- DLP --> Data Loss Prevention
- Final model must be able to withstand DNS exfiltration tests

Oct 2:
- To find a solid dataset (not necessarily large amounts of data)
- Research features and compile a list of them
